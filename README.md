**Color Detection using Convolutional Neural Network**

---

**Introduction:**
Color detection using CNN is a process of identifying and classifying colors present in an image. This task is essential in various applications such as image processing, computer vision, and robotics. 
---

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color_detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd color_detection

    ```

---

**Usage:**

1. Prepare your input images: Place your input image in the drag and drop file User Interface

2. Run the colorization script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Wait for the Color detecting process to complete. The detected color present in the images will displayed in the output

**Model:**

The colorization model used in this project is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It takes a an image as input and predicts the corresponding colors present in the image.

---

**Customization:**

Feel free to experiment with different architectures, loss functions, and training strategies to improve the colorization results. You can also fine-tune the model on your own dataset for specific applications.
